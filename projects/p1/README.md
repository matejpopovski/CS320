# Project 1: Review, Git Analysis, Benchmarking

## Overview

This project is longer than usual, with 32 questions, because it is
designed to get familiar with Python basics (or review them if you
took 220). The first 75% can be done as a group and focuses on
review. The last 25% is individual and focuses on new 320 concepts.

Learning objectives:

- write code to control the flow of execution with loops, functions, and if statements
- extract values from Python state (variables, data structures, etc), including nested list and dict structures
- use the `pandas` package to read CSV files into DataFrames and analyze/plot the resulting data
- write code to analyze the history of a git project
- measure performance (how long it takes to run things)

**Note:** some browsers have a "dark mode" -- be careful not to use it when looking at plot examples (it often hides axis labels in the examples, which you need for full credit).

## Setup

Make sure to complete Lab 1 before starting this, as it must be done on your
virtual machine.

1. SSH to your virtual machine by running `ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS`

If you don't recall these from lab, you can find your username
(https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/metadata/sshKeys) and
External IP address
(https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) in Google's
console.

2. Run `pip3 install pandas==1.4.4 matplotlib==3.5.3`

3. Please refer to the GitLab tutorial for instructions on how to clone your personal GitLab repository

4. Go to `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:2020/` in the browser (sign in, if prompted)

Jupyter should still be running from when you started it during lab, but if it's not, you can start it again with the following:

`nohup python3 -m jupyterlab --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=2020 &`

5. Enter the `mp1` directory (expand the folder icon on the left of the screen if you don't see these directories)
6. Click to create a new `Python 3 (ipykernel)` notebook

7. Go to "File" > "Rename Notebook", and name your notebook "mp1.ipynb"

## Testing

Your notebook should follow this format to be compatible with the tester:

```python
# project: p1
# submitter: ????
# partner: none
# hours: ????
```

```python
# import statements
```

```python
#Q1
some code, output answer
```

```python
#Q2
some code, output answer
```

\*Do not include the question or anything else after "#Q\_\_"

1. Do a "Kernel" > "Restart Kernel & Run All Cells" in your notebook

2. "File" > "Save Notebook"

3. From an SSH session, navigate to the project directory

4. Run `python3 tester.py p1.ipynb` and work on fixing any issues

## Submission

Your notebook should have a comment like this:

```python
# project: p1
# submitter: ????
# partner: none
# hours: ????
```

For submitter, use your NetID (part before @wisc.edu in your email).
Estimate how many hours you spent on the project. This semester,
"partner" should always be "none". Don't list people on your assigned
study group.

Submit as follows: _CURRENTLY UPDATING GRADING PROCESS - WILL CHANGE SOON_

1. Once you are done with your project you will submit it by creating a merge request

2. To do this...

# Group Part (75%)

For this portion of the project, you may collaborate with your group
members in any way (even looking at working code). You may also seek
help from 320 staff (mentors, TAs, instructor). You <b>may not</b>
seek receive help from other 320 students (outside your group) or
anybody outside the course.

## Python Control Flow (Part 1)

### Q1: what is the type of `8/3`?

Take a look at the builtin Python functions to see if one can answer this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

Some functions we use a lot in 220/320 are abs, dir, float, input, int, len, list, max, min, range, set, sorted, str, sum, type.

In most programming languages, 8 and 3 are ints, so the result of dividing these is an int (2, after rounding down 2.66). In Python, the standard division operator `/` produces the mathematically correct answer, even though it is not an int (like 8 and 3). `//` does something different. Take a look at the resulting types to spot the difference.

**Note**: Python has changed over the years, and their are some differences between Python 2 and Python 3. At this point, Python 2 is
no longer supported and is only used in legacy projects; however, it's good to be aware of the differences in case you ever work with Python 2 code.
In Python 2, `8 / 3` returns `2` as an `int`.

**IMPORTANT**: After solving every question, we recommend running the tester, to confirm whether your code is able to clear the auto-grader tests locally on your VM. For example, after solving q1, if you run the tester, you will see the output will look similar to the below image:

<img src="img/tester.png">

Please keep in mind that even though your code might clear the tester on your local VM, it might fail the tester on the submission portal. It is your responsibility to check that your submission clears auto-grader on the submission portal (course website). You will receive a canvas message when the auto-grader test results are ready - **PLEASE DO NOT IGNORE THAT** - and make sure to check your auto-grader test results on time.

### Q2: what is `error`?

Complete the code in accordance with the comment to calculate the answer.

```python
x = 4
maximum = 15
minimum = 5
error = ???? # False if x is inside the minimum-to-maximum range
error
```

Notes:

1. we don't need to specify the type of our variables as in some languages (e.g., Java) -- Python knows x is an `int` because we assigned `4`, which is an int. Variable types are not fixed after creation as in some languages (e.g., Go) -- we could later run `x = "howdy"` if we wanted to
2. in Python, a `bool` is `True` or `False`. We use the `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to operate on `bool`s. In other programming languages, these operators are often expressed as `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

### Q3: ignoring case, does `word` end with the suffix "ian"?

Complete the following to answer:

```python
word = "QUOTIDIAN"
suffix_match = ???? # .endswith(...) method not allowed for this question! (practice slicing)
suffix_match
```

Skim string methods here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods. Some important ones: `find`, `isdigit`, `join`, `split`, `lower`, `upper`, `strip`, `replace`.

Hints:

1. to ignore case, it's often easy to use a method to make everything upper or lower case
2. to get a single character from a string, you can use `s[INDEX]`. 0 is the first character, 1 is the second, and so on. Python supports negative indexing, meaning `s[-1]` is the last letter, `s[-2]` is the next to last, etc. You can also _slice_ strings to get a substring by putting a colon between two indexes `s[inclusive_start:exclusive_end]`. You can leave off one of the indexes to go to the start or end of the string. For example, `word[:3]` would evaluate to `"KAE"`.
3. in Java, you compare strings with `s1.equals(s2)`, but in Python the correct equivalent is `s1 == s2`. The equivalent of Java's `==` is Python's rarely used `is` operator.

### Requirement `check_sum` function:

Your function should generally take three numbers and check if the sum of the first two is equal to the third. For example, `check_sum(1, 2, 3)` should return `True`. Users of the function should also be able to call it like `check_sum(x=1, y=2, sum=3)`. If fewer than three arguments are passed, `x=0`, `y=0`, `sum=0`, should be used as default.

Python parameters may be filled with positions arguments, keyword arguments, or default arguments. If this is unfamiliar, read the following:

1. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions
2. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions

In Python, indents are very important. The code inside a function/conditional/loop is indented (Python doesn't use `{` and `}` to indicate this, as in Java and many other languages).

### Q4: what is `check_sum(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)`?

Call your function to answer. If the answer is not intuitive, check what is `0.1 + 0.2`.

### Q5: what is `check_sum(-1, 1)`?

### Q6: what is `status`?

Complete the following so that `status` says something meaningful about `x`.

```python
x = 4
if ????:
    status = "odd"
elif ????:
    status = "even"
else:
    status = "non-integer"
status
```

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements

### Requirement: `nums` list and `neg_sum` function

Paste the following:

```python
nums = [3, 4, 1, 6]
for x in nums:
    print(x)
```

Python lists can be created like `[item1, item2, ...]` and indexed/sliced just like strings (strings and lists are both examples of Python _sequences_; by definition, you can index and slice any kind of sequence you encounter in Python). This list contains just ints, but you're free to have a mix of types in Python lists.

In general, you can plug in a variable name and sequence into a `for` loop to run a piece of code for every entry in the sequence:

```python
for ???? in ????:
    # DO SOMETHING
```

More on `for` loops:

- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops

Write a function called `neg_sum` that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum. It should also have the following features:

1. only sums numbers that are negative
2. once the sum is below -20 (strictly less than -20), all the numbers that follow it, positive or negative, should be skipped
3. **Note**: if you try to use `sum` as the variable to keep track of the sum, notice how it turns green. Anything that turns green inside notebook file format is a Python keyword, meaning you shouldn't be using that as a variable. Can you think of a better variable name than `sum`? Learn this skill early so that you don't accidentally redefine the meaning of the keywords that already have a different meaning.

Use `continue` to implement feature 1 and `break` to implement feature 2.

### Q7: what is `neg_sum(nums)`?

### Q8: what is `neg_sum([-5, 1, -11, -6, 15, -1, 8, 2])`?

The answer should be -22: -5-11-6. All positive numbers should be skipped. -1 and 8 and 2 are skipped because the sum is already less than -20.

## Python State (Part 2)

### Requirement: lists and dicts

Copy/paste the following:

```python
header = ["A", "B", "C"]

coord1 = {"x": 8, "y": 5}
coord2 = {"x": 9, "y": 2, "z" : 4}
coord3 = {"x": 3, "y": 1, "z" : 7}

rows = [
    [1, 6, 7, 8, coord1],
    [3, 4, 9, coord2],
    [5, 2, coord3],
]
```

Note that `rows` is a list of lists. Each inner list contains some number of ints and one dict (dictionary). For complicated nested structures like this, it's often helpful to visualize the stack of frames and heap of objects in PythonTutor: https://pythontutor.com/live.html#mode=edit.

You could copy the above to visualize it, or use the following link for your convenience:

https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=header%20%3D%20%5B%22A%22,%20%22B%22,%20%22C%22%5D%0A%0Acoord1%20%3D%20%7B%22x%22%3A%208,%20%22y%22%3A%205%7D%0Acoord2%20%3D%20%7B%22x%22%3A%209,%20%22y%22%3A%202%7D%0Acoord3%20%3D%20%7B%22x%22%3A%203,%20%22y%22%3A%201%7D%0A%0Arows%20%3D%20%5B%0A%20%20%20%20%5B1,%206,%20coord1%5D,%0A%20%20%20%20%5B3,%204,%20coord2%5D,%0A%20%20%20%20%5B5,%202,%20coord3%5D,%0A%5D&cumulative=false&curInstr=7&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false

Both lists and dicts contain values. With lists, each value is associated with an index (integers starting from 0). With dicts, each value is associated with a key specified by the programmers. Keys are often strings, but they don't need to be.

Docs:

- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries

**Testing Note:** try running `{"A":1, "B":2} == {"B":2, "A":1}` in Python. Note that these two dicts are considered equivalent since they have the same values corresponding to the same keys. So if the tester complains about any of your dicts (or sets) being wrong, the issue is with the contents, not the order.

### Q9: after inserting a "w" key in `coord3` (with `coord3["w"] = 6`), what is `rows`?

### Q10: what is the value associated with the "x" key of the dict in the last position of the first list?

**Hint:** if the question were "what is the value associated with the 'y' key of the dict in the last position of the second list?", the solution would be: `rows[1][-1]["y"]`. You just need to track on brackets containing indexes (for lists) or keys (for dicts) to delve deeper into a nested structure.

### Q11: what is `rows` after running the following?

Complete the following so that the first change via `v2` is NOT reflected in `rows`, but the second change via `v2` IS reflected in `rows`:

```python
import copy
v2 = ????
v2[0] = 404    # first change
v2[1][1] = 404 # second change
```

Relevant docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html

To get a good intuition about the reference/shallow/deep copy, try stepping through the following slowly in PythonTutor:

```python
import copy
v1 = [[1], [], [2, 3]]
v2 = v1
v2 = copy.copy(v1)
v2 = copy.deepcopy(v1)
```

### Q12: if we imagine the list of lists structure referenced by `rows` as a table, with column names in `header`, what is the sum of values in the "B" column?

Note: the "B" column corresponds to the values at index in 1 of each list, but you are not allowed to hardcode 1 for this solution. Instead, use `header.index(????)` to look up the position of "B" within the `header` list.

### Q13: what is `rows` after we sort it in-place by the "B" column, ascending?

Docs:

- https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sorting-basics
- https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions

Hint: if we had to sort by the "A" column **descending**, we could do the following:

```python
def get_column_a(row):
    print("lookup A column for a row")
    return row[header.index("A")]

rows.sort(key=get_column_a, reverse=True)
rows
```

Note that we aren't calling `get_column_a` ourselves (because there are no parentheses after it on the sort line). Instead, we're giving the `sort` method a reference to that function; this allows `sort` to call the function on each row, to figure out what part of the row objects matters for the sort.

When we only need a function for one purpose, we can use the `lambda` syntax instead of the `def` syntax to define the function on a single line, without even giving it a name. The following works the same as the earlier example (but without the print):

```python
rows.sort(key=lambda row: row[header.index("A")], reverse=True)
rows
```

### Q14: say you're going on vacation to Canada with 1000 US dollars; how many Canadian dollars can you get at the current exchange rate?

This site provides exchange rate information in JSON format: https://www.floatrates.com/json-feeds.html. JSON is a simple format that can represent nested dicts and lists in files and web resources.

Download a copy of `usd.json` to the directory where your project is. An easy way is to open a terminal, `cd` to the appriate directory, then run `wget SOME_URL_HERE` to download the web resource.

Note: you can run shell commands in Jupyter, too, if you start the command with a `!` (to indicate it is not Python code). If you do this, be sure to delete the cell after the download. Otherwise you'll create too much traffic on the floatrates.com site, re-downloading the same thing every time you re-run your notebook.

You can read a file like this:

```python
f = open("usd.json")
data = f.read()
f.close()
```

Check the type of `data` and the first portion of it:

```python
print(type(data))
print(data[:300] + "...")
```

Even though the file contains a string that _could_ be interpreted as JSON, Python won't _deserialize_ it to Python dicts/lists automatically. Instead of calling `.read()`, we need to use the `load` function in the `json` module:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load

When reading documentation, start by focusing on parameters that can't take default arguments.

Access the exchange rate for Canadian dollars in the dictionary and multiply it by the amount of US dollars you have to find out how many Canadian dollars you can get. You can round to the nearest 0.01 dollar (1 cent).

**Important**: Note the difference between `json.load()` and `json.loads()`. The first loads json data from a file, whereas the second loads json data from a
Python string.

### Requirement: `divide` function

Normally, if you divide by 0, you'll get an exception. Write a function that does division; when there is such an exception, is should catch it and return the float `nan` (not a number).

How to catch exceptions: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions

To get the Python `nan` object, you can convert a string: `float("nan")`

Requirement: the function should only catch the exception that gets thrown for division by zero (not other exceptions). To find the name of this exception, you could try doing a simple division by zero in a cell and observe what gets thrown.

### Q15: what is `divide(5, 2)`?

### Q16: what is `divide(0, 0)`?

## Python Data Science (Part 3)

The US Census Bureau conducts the ACS (American Community Survey) yearly, asking a variety of questions. The following gives data on household computer use from the years 2017 to 2021:

https://data.census.gov/table?t=Computer+and+Internet+Use&g=010XX00US$0400000&tid=ACSDT5Y2021.B28001

We have downloaded the data for each year to a file in the `home-computers` directory.

Create a dictionary called `years` like this:

- **key**: a year (`int`), corresponding to a year of data in the directory. Don't hardcode the years -- use `os.listdir` and extract the year from each filename (right before the first `.`). Check if the file is a CSV by checking if it ends with ".csv". Don't hardcode the years in the dictionary - use the year extracted from the file name as the key.
- **value**: a pandas DataFrame corresponding to the CSV for that year. Skip the first row from each CSV file: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html. Use `set_index` (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html) to make "Geographic Area Name" the index of the DataFrame. This will let you easily look up state stats by name (instead of by row number) later.

### Q17: what are the keys in `years`?

Answer with a sorted list.

### Q18: how many households did Wisconsin have in 2021?

The answer is in the column with name "Estimate!!Total" and row with NAME "Wisconsin". The hardcoding way to answer (not allowed) would be something like:

```python
df = years[2021]
df.iat[49, 1] # iat works like df.iloc[, 1], but is faster for one cell
```

Instead of hardcoding 49 and 1, you can use "Wisconsin" (row index name) and "Estimate!!Total" (column name). When using names instead of positions, you just need to use `.at` or `.loc` (instead of `.iat`).

### Q19: how many total households in the US are estimated to not have any computer at home? (2021)

The data is in the "Estimate!!Total!!No Computer" column.

If `df` is a DataFrame, `df["some column name here"]` will extract an individual column as a Pandas Series. A Pandas Series is like a list/dict hybrid. You can use `.iat` to look up values by integer position (like you would with a list). You can use `.at` to look up values by the Series' index, like you would with a dict. Note the confusing terminology here: a Series' index is like a dict's key, and the "i" in "iat" does NOT refer to "index".

If you have a Pandas Series `s`, you can do various aggregations on it, like `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.max()`, etc.

### Q20: what is the biggest per-state margin of error for "No Computer", as a fraction of the total estimate? (2021)

The margin of error is given in the "Margin of Error!!Total!!No Computer" column.

You can divide one Pandas Series by another on an element-wise basis like this: `s3 = s2 / s1`. You can then compute `s3.max()`. Or better, see if you can combine everything into a one-line computation.

### Q21: for Wisconsin and adjacent states, what percent of households are estimated to be without a computer? (2021)

**States**: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin.

Use the "Estimate!!Total!!No Computer" and "Estimate!!Total" columns to calculate the percentage of households without a computer.

Answer with a `dict`, where the key is the state name, and the value is the percentage i.e. `1` for "1%" or "0.01".

### Q22: same question, but answer with a bar plot.

If you have a Series `s`, you can use `s.plot.bar()` or `s.plot.barh()`. The labels of the x-axis and y-axis should be as shown in the below graph.

Example:

<img src="img/q22.png">

### Q23: how has the number of WI households without computers changed over recent years?

Answer with a plot like this: The labels of x-axis and y-axis should be as shown in the below graph.

<img src="img/q23.png">

Hint : Divide the data by 1000 to get the number of households without computers in thousands.

### Q24: what is the relationship between household with smartphones and those with tablets? (2021)

Answer with a plot like this: The labels of x-axis and y-axis should be as shown in the below graph.

<img src="img/q24.png">

Extract below Columns from the dataframe:

- "Estimate!!Total!!Has one or more types of computing devices!!Smartphone"
- "Estimate!!Total!!Has one or more types of computing devices!!Tablet or other portable wireless computer"

Hint:
Divide the values for the "Smartphones (millions)" and "Tablets (millions)" columns by 1e6 to convert them to millions.

# Individual Part (25%)

You have to do the remainder of this project on your own. Do not
discuss with anybody except 320 staff (mentors, TAs, instructor).

For this part, you'll do two things:

1. analyze the history of this project: https://github.com/pallets/flask. We'll eventually learn how to use the flask module to build web applications -- for now we'll just analyze changes to the codebase over time.
2. measure how long various Pandas operations take

We have a copy of the flask repo in `flask.zip`. Run `unzip flask.zip`. If `unzip` is not installed, follow the suggestion in the error message to install it. If that doesn't work because you don't have admin permissions, re-run the suggested command with `sudo` in front of the suggestion (that runs the command as the super/root/admin user).

### Q25: what is the first line of output from `git log` when run in the `flask` repo directory?

If you pass `cwd="????"` to `check_output`, you can run the `git log` command inside the `flask` directory that was created when you ran the `git clone` command. "CWD" stands for "change working directory".

The `check_output` function in the `subprocess` module (https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output) returns a byte sequence; consider converting it to a string ("utf-8" encoding) and splitting it by newline (`\n`) to get a list. This will be useful for answering the following questions.

**Important:** if you use `git checkout` commands (as required for following exercises) to switch the current (HEAD) commit, the output of `git log` will change (it will show the current commit and prior ones, but not future commits). You may want to add some code that runs `git checkout main` to bring the HEAD back to the latest commit. Otherwise your answer to this question might only be correct the first time you run the notebook.

### Q26: What are the commit numbers of the 10 earliest commits?

Answer with a list. Commits with earlier timestamp should be later in the list.
(Hint: Since `git log` puts earlier commits later in the output, you don't need to reorder the commits.)

### Q27: what did the `README` file contain after the 100th commit?

Use `check_output` to run a `git checkout` command to switch to that commit, before reading `flask/README` the way you would read any regular text file in Python (using `open` and `.read`).

### Q28: how many pull requests were merged from each GitHub user? Only output users who appear 10 or more times.

When running `git log`, you'll see some entries like this:

```
commit 7b0c82dfdc867641dd6e1b200f735bffd66e4c12
Merge: c5ca1750 a841cfab
Author: David Lord <davidism@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 22 17:10:24 2021 -0800

    Merge pull request #4350 from olliemath/patch-1

    Only use a custom JSONDecoder if needed
```

This means the code was approved by David Lord (who has permission to make changes), but the code change was written and proposed by olliemath.

Whenever a line from `git log` contains the text "Merge pull request" and "/", extract the username immediately before the "/". Count occurences of usernames in a dictionary like the following:

```
{'pallets': 204,
 'pgjones': 14,
 'greyli': 42,
 'ThiefMaster': 11,
 'davidism': 45,
 'untitaker': 20,
 'ThomasWaldmann': 13,
 'SimonSapin': 11}
```

Note: there will be some entries like the following that are actually undoing a pull request:

```
Revert "Merge pull request #859 from wvh/register_error_handler"
```

For simplicity, we'll count these just like the original pull requests.

### Q29: what is the output of `pip3 instal`? (yes, the mispelling was intentional)

This one will be difficult because the command will fail, triggering
an exception. First, run this by itself to determine what exception
type is thrown in this circumstance:

```python
check_output(["pip3", "instal"])
```

Now, adapt this code to get the output, regardless of whether the
program runs or fails:

Search the page here to learn about the exception type, and import it: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html

Then, use that information to catch exceptions of that type (fill in the missing exception type):

```python
import subprocess

try:
    msg = check_output(["pip3", "instal"], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
except subprocess.???? as e:
    msg = e.output
```

Note that `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT` tells `check_output` that error
messages should be treated as regular output -- that lets us capture
the output with `e.output`.

### Q30: what is faster for looping over a DataFrame, `iterrows` or `itertuples`?

We'll want to generate test data of various sizes. Use this function for that purpose:

```python
def rand_df(rows):
    return pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(10, size=(rows, 5)),
                        columns=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
                        index=[f"r{i}" for i in range(1, rows+1)])
```

Answer with a plot as follows:

- x-axis is number of number of rows in a DataFrame
- y-axis is milliseconds is how long it takes to loop over the DataFrame
- two lines: one for `iterrows` and one for `itertuples`

If you have a DataFrame generated from `rand_df` called `df`, you can take a measurement like this:

```python
import time

t0 = time.time()
# HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE TO RUN, FOR DATAFRAMES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF ROWS?
for row in df.iterrows():
    pass
t1 = time.time()
```

Your plot should look something like this (we're hiding the legend labels so it's a surprise for you which is faster). The labels of x-axis and y-axis should be as shown in the below graph.

Some noise is OK as long as you get the same general shape (we get a slightly different plot each time we measure ourselves).

The easiest way to create a plot with two lines is to create a DataFrame with a column of measurements corresponding to each line. Here's a simple example to adapt:

```python
times_df = pd.DataFrame(dtype=float)
times_df.at[1, "A"] = 50
times_df.at[2, "A"] = 60
times_df.at[1, "B"] = 35
times_df.at[2, "B"] = 34
times_df.plot.line()
```

### Q31: what is faster, `loc`, or `at`?

Answer with a line plot, similar to the one for the previous question. Here is a code snippet to use for the measurement (adapt to measure `.at` as well):

```python
# HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE TO RUN, FOR DATAFRAMES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF ROWS?
total = 0
for idx in df.index:
    for col in df.columns:
        total += df.loc[idx, col]
```

### Q32: what is faster, a loop or `.apply`?

Answer this one with a line plot similar to the last two. You should, however, have measurements going up to 20000 rows.

The two code snippets to measure:

```python
# HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE TO RUN, FOR DATAFRAMES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF ROWS?
result = df["A"].apply(laugh).tolist()
```

AND

```python
# HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE TO RUN, FOR DATAFRAMES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF ROWS?
result = []
for val in df["A"]:
    result.append(laugh(val))
```

The `laugh` function is defined as follows:

```python
def laugh(x):
    return "qwerty" * x
```
